# Customer Retention

**Customer Churn**, also known as customer attrition, or customer turnover, is the loss of customers and it is an important and challenging problem for ecomerce and online businesses. 

One of the metrics to keep track of customer churn is **Retention Rate**, an indication of to what degree the products satisfie a strong market demand, known as product-market fit. If a product-market fit is not satisfactory, a company will likely experience customers churning. 

A powerful tool to analyse and improve Retention Rate is Churn Prediction; a technique that helps to find out which customer is more likely to churn in the given period of time.

### Aims

The aim of this project is to:

- Build a classification model to predict which customers will churn
- Analyze how the different features affect retention or more specifically, customer churn

#

### Data

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/adammaus/predicting-churn-for-bank-customers) used for this project was obtained from Kaggle. It contains data about customers who are withdrawing their account from a bank.


### Files

This repo contains the following files:

- `churn_analysis.ipynb` 

- A CSV file named `Churn_Modelling.csv` which contains the data from the bank customers



a. A jupyter notebook named content_based_music_recommender that contains the code and analysis for the recommedation system.
