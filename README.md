# Customer Retention

**Customer Churn**, also known as customer attrition, or customer turnover, is the loss of customers and it is an important and challenging problem for ecomerce and online businesses. 

One of the metrics to keep track of customer churn is **Retention Rate**, an indication of to what degree the products satisfie a strong market demand, known as product-market fit. If a product-market fit is not satisfactory, a company will likely experience customers churning. 

A powerful tool to analyse and improve Retention Rate is Churn Prediction; a technique that helps to find out which customer is more likely to churn in the given period of time.
